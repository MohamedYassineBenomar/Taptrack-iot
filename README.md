# 🏫 Attendance Control System

This project is part of the **Project Module** at the TIC Institute of Barcelona (2025-2026 academic year).
We are three students and we have developed an **attendance control system** for students, teachers, and service staff.

## 🎯 Project objective

To create a simple, secure, and functional system to manage attendance within the institute.
The system collects data from a physical device (ESP32 with RFID card reader) and sends it to a database through a server.
We also designed a **prototype of a web and mobile application** for managing justifications and attendance queries.
